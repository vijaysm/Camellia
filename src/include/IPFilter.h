 Prototype IPFilter.

 Allows the definition of a LocalStiffnessMatrixFilter via a trial-space IP object.  Notion is that you might want to minimize (e_i, e_j)_E + (e_i, e_j)_ip, where E is the energy norm, and _ip is the inner product defined by the IP object.  Could be used for resolution of the extra constant mode in Stokes operator, e.g., if _ip were defined as (p,p)_L^2, say.

{
  IPPtr _ip;
public:
  IPFilter(IPPtr ip); // idea is to use an IP on the trial space to add L^2 penalty terms.  In the case of Stokes I want integral of p = 0, so I might use an ip defined as (p,p).

              BasisCachePtr basisCache, Teuchos::RCP<Mesh> mesh, Teuchos::RCP<BC> bc);
